# TO-DO: create a StructType for the Reservation schema for the following fields:
# {"reservationId":"814840107","customerName":"Jim Harris", "truckNumber":"15867", "reservationDate":"Sep 29, 2020, 10:06:23 AM"}

# TO-DO: create a StructType for the Payment schema for the following fields:
# {"reservationId":"9856743232","customerName":"Frank Aristotle","date":"Sep 29, 2020, 10:06:23 AM","amount":"946.88"}

# TO-DO: create a spark session, with an appropriately named application name

#TO-DO: set the log level to WARN

#TO-DO: read the redis-server kafka topic as a source into a streaming dataframe with the bootstrap server kafka:19092, configuring the stream to read the earliest messages possible                                    

#TO-DO: using a select expression on the streaming dataframe, cast the key and the value columns from kafka as strings, and then select them

#TO-DO: using the redisMessageSchema StructType, deserialize the JSON from the streaming dataframe 

# TO-DO: create a temporary streaming view called "RedisData" based on the streaming dataframe
# it can later be queried with spark.sql

#TO-DO: using spark.sql, select key, zSetEntries[0].element as redisEvent from RedisData

#TO-DO: from the dataframe use the unbase64 function to select a column called redisEvent with the base64 decoded JSON, and cast it to a string

#TO-DO: repeat this a second time, so now you have two separate dataframes that contain redisEvent data

#TO-DO: using the reservation StructType, deserialize the JSON from the first redis decoded streaming dataframe, selecting column reservation.* as a temporary view called Reservation 

#TO-DO: using the payment StructType, deserialize the JSON from the second redis decoded streaming dataframe, selecting column payment.* as a temporary view called Payment 

#TO-DO: using spark.sql select select reservationId, reservationDate from Reservation where reservationDate is not null

#TO-DO: using spark.sql select reservationId as paymentReservationId, date as paymentDate, amount as paymentAmount from Payment

#TO-DO: join the reservation and payment data using the expression: reservationId=paymentReservationId

# TO-DO: write the stream to the console, and configure it to run indefinitely
# can you find the reservations who haven't made a payment on their reservation?
