# Udacity-Data-Streaming

## Chicago-transit-authority
* project 1: Kafka, ksql, faust, stream processing web app.
* In this project, you will construct a streaming event pipeline around Apache Kafka and its ecosystem. Using public data from the Chicago Transit Authority we will construct an event pipeline around Kafka that allows us to simulate and display the status of train lines in real time.

## SF Crime Statistics with Spark Streaming
* project 2: Spark, Kafka, Kaggle.
* In this project, you will be provided with a real-world dataset, extracted from Kaggle, on San Francisco crime incidents, and you will provide statistical analyses of the data using Apache Spark Structured Streaming. You will draw on the skills and knowledge you've learned in this course to create a Kafka server to produce data, and ingest data through Spark Structured Streaming.
